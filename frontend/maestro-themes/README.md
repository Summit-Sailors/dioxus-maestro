# Maestro Themes

`Shadcn-style` pre-theming for Dioxus Applications

## Drafts

- Could users configure which theme properties are exposed in the designer? might lead to additional configs within the state.rs
- There is consideration for a build script for generating code or processing assets
- at the moment, we maintain tailwindcss (there can room for other exporters later on)
